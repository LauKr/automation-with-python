# Automation with Python

An automation of e.g. the Downloads folder file management using Python.


## Prerequisites

As this project uses Python you'll need Python installed (tested with 
Python 3.9) with the following packages:
* OS
* shutil

## Usage

To perform a full automation run just use the file main.py, if you want 
just a specific part then use the corresponding file.
```
python main.py
```

You can also add the file to your cron for recurring execution.
